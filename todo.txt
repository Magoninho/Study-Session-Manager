To-do:
- Make forms have no errors
- Find the better way of counting time without setInterval
- remove seconds because they are not necessary (when the project is finished)
- do the breaks
- get the input from the html
- refactor the code
- document the code functions and classes

Ideas for refactoring:
- create a generic timer class
